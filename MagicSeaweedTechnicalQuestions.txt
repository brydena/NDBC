1. How long did you spend completing the assignment? How (if at all) would you change
your solution if you had more time?

Around 6-8 hours. I would change to a more friendly interface than the command line.
I would also probably change the code and store the bouy readings as custom objects rather than a list.
Although this would depend on how the data was to be used. 

2. Can you describe a feature (perhaps with some reference code) that exists in your
chosen programming language that you found particularly useful?

List comprehension in Python, the ability to quickly create lists without the need for repeated for loops. See line 23.
Also the inbuilt functions in Python for example in requests often make complicated procedures easy.


3. How would you track down a performance issue with yours or another developer's code?

First I would look into any code which may be waiting on a response or where the network/internet connection speed may be limiting.
If it appears that it may be due to certain operations that are causing the slow down I would use functions such as timeit in python to see which functions my be 
causing performace issues.
